		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<h3>Q: What are those numbers next to the Digimon in the Auction House?</h3>
				<p>Just as we have our currencies, so does the Digital World. Digimon use Bits, Mega, and Terra as their currency. </p>
				<p>Bits are the smallest units. </p>
				<p>Mega are made up of 1,000 Bits. </p>
				<p>Terra is made up of 1,000 mega, or 10,000 Bits.</p>
				<p>We were able to work out an exchange rate with the Digital World between Bits and American dollars. It's a 10:1 ratio of 10 cents= 1 Bit.</p>
			<h3>Q: I missed my chance to record the digimon fromt he outbreaks! How do I get them?</h3>
				<p>Unfortunately, we cannot open the virus chest to let you look for safety reasons. However, it is also unreasonable to have you wait until they escape again (which we don't want), so we have made it so you can trade Digimon with others and obtain their data that way.</p>
				<p>That said, truly malicous ones will only be found in the <a href="dgvirus.html">virus chest</a>, where have provided a way to get their info safely.</p>
