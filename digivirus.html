		<h1> Outbreaks</h1>
		<p>Greetings, Cybersleuths! Below is a list Digimon of the nefarious digimon that have caused havoc in our world at one point in time, now quarantined to our virus chest. Normally, we can contain them without issue, but sometimes they escape. When they do, we go after them again immediately. We also post the annoucement on the <a href="outbreaks.html"></a>outbreaks</a> page for those that wish to assist us with that. <br> For those looking to fill out their Digidex, we, unfortunately, we can't let you into the chest for safety reasons; we can only go as far as posting their images (as they were last seen as) and the data we have gathered on them. 
			<br>
		<p>That said, scanning these QR codes is a safe way to add them to your Digidex</p>
